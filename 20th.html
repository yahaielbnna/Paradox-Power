      <h1>Coal Chronicles: The Rise of Fossil Fuels</h1>
      <p>
        Step into the mid-20th century, a time when
        <font>coal and other fossil fuels powered the world</font>, driving
        massive industrial growth and technological advancements. This era,
        marked by the Industrial Revolution, saw coal become the main source of
        <font>electricity and energy</font>, fueling factories, trains, and
        homes. However, this rapid development came with significant
        environmental impacts that we still face today. In the bustling cities
        and expanding industries of the 20th century, coal was king. It powered
        the steam engines that drove the Industrial Revolution, transforming
        economies and societies. Factories were busy, trains traveled across
        continents, and homes were warmed by coal fires. But as the smoke rose
        and the skies darkened, the environmental consequences began to show.
        <font>Air pollution</font> became common, and early signs of
        <font>climate change</font> started to appear. Your mission is to
        understand the environmental impacts of fossil fuels. You will collect
        and <font>arrange</font> photos showing the use of coal and other fossil
        fuels during the 20th century, highlighting both the industrial
        advancements and the environmental damage.
