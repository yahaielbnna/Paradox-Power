        Step into the late 1800s, a time of groundbreaking innovation and
        intense rivalry. The world stands on the brink of a technological
        revolution, driven by two brilliant minds: Nikola Tesla and Thomas
        Edison. Their fierce competition, known as the
        <font>War of Currents</font>, will determine the future of electricity.
        <br />
        Your Mission: As you enter the <font>War of Currents</font> lab, you
        find yourself in a bustling 19th-century workshop filled with the hum of
        machinery and the glow of electric lamps. The air is thick with the
        excitement of discovery and the tension of competition. <br />
        You must first <font>choose your side</font>: Will you align with Nikola
        Tesla, the visionary who champions Alternating Current (AC), or will you
        support Thomas Edison, the steadfast advocate of Direct Current (DC)?
        Your decision will shape your journey through this electrifying
        adventure. <br />
        With your allegiance decided you are tasked with a critical mission:
        <font>Light Up the Bulb</font>. Using your chosen current, you must
        design a circuit that successfully illuminates a bulb. This challenge
        will require you to delve into the principles of voltage and master the
        intricacies of series and parallelÂ circuits
